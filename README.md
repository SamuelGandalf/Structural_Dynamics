# Structural_Dynamics
This repository contains implementations of the Central Difference algorithm and the Newmark algorithm in python code. This is as part of my undergraduate CE 456-Structual Dynamics course assignment. Also included is the generation of the tripartite charts more like the El Centro. The KERN_PEL ground motion data is used in all of the algorithms.
